Created project. Installed next.js. Installed the babel-plugin for styled-components to support server-side rendering. Created .babelrc-file for babel config. Created react components.

Started basic styling to have an overview of the different components.


To do list in priority-order:
- Save button to save the entire souvenir in state somewhere.
- Create an Souvenirs component with every Souvenir in the state/props.
- Style 2nd page of the form
- Black/White font color in 2nd page depending on what color user picks for background.
- Background color shouldnt take up the entire page after mobile size.
- Animation when alternating pages
